<h2>CoAbode Time-Dollar Network</h2>

			<h3>Summary</h3>
			<p>For my Computer Science Capstone Project at USC, I led a team of ten students to develop a "time-dollar" social network prototype for <a href="http://www.coabode.com">CoAbode</a>, a non-profit organization that provides resources and support for single mothers. This network allowed single mothers in the same geographical area to provide and receive services from each other in exchange for "time dollars." For example, if a single mother did not have the physical ability or time to do a task, she could request that it be done for her by other single mothers in the network, rewarding the latter with time dollars that she could spend to make her own requests. A high-level view can be seen on our <a href="uploads/CoAbodePosterFinal.pdf">poster</a>.</p>

			<h3>Technology &amp; Contributions</h3>
			<p>We developed this site using Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, jQuery, Bootstrap, and Amazon S3 (for file uploads), leveraging Heroku to house our prototype.</p>
			
			<p>My contributions were extensive, both technically and in driving the completion of the project. On the technical side, I developed the entire AJAX-enabled profile workflow (#1 on poster), enabling quick and detailed profile setup for new members. In addition, I also developed the entire administrative suite for CoAbode leaders and the transactions workflow that enabled members to track their tasks, completions, and rewards/debits.</p>
			
			<p>Beyond the feature contributions, I conducted the product management, leading the client meetings with the co-founders of CoAbode, driving the design and testing, and tracking tasks and milestones. I also applied my strong teaching abilities, helping a struggling teammate outside of team meetings to better understand the Rails and jQuery frameworks. From this interaction, my teammate then went on to design and implement a critical tagging feature, used for searching for and labeling tasks and profiles.</p>
			
			<h3>Awards</h3>
			<p>At the conclusion of the course, all projects were presented at the <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/news/news/2012/capstone-projects-show.htm">annual KIUEL Senior Design Expo</a>. During this event, the project was demonstrated to Expo judges and general student and faculty visitors alike. Our project was officially judged 3rd out of 12 diverse engineering projects in the Expo, and we also won the <a href="http://viterbi.usc.edu/students/undergrad/involvement/kiuel/cross-disciplinary/senior-design-expo-2012.htm">"Most Popular"/"Fan Favorite"</a> project award by a large margin.</p>
